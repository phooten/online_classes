Purpose:
	While Trying to make NFT's, I got interested in the process of making alot of different
	items with slight changes. I would like to use this program in order learn about this generation,
	and to learn more about showing and using computer graphics

Order:
	- Create base bottle outline, add background color, change color of both
	- Add extra features: Clothes (costume, hats, shoes, pants), Items (soccer ball, ) 
	- Add lightsource / shadow
